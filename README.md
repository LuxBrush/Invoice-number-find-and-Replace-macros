# Invoice number find and Replace macro for LibreOffice

I made this macro to search formulas in my spreadsheet for an invoice number and replace it with
a new one from a given list in the first column of the spreadsheet.

You can import this file in to LibreOffice by copying and pasting the text from it into an open blank
macro in LibreOffice.
